🧮 Simple Calculator (DOM Project)

A beginner-level calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a clean and responsive interface. It’s a great hands-on exercise for learning **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript.
